# Foundational models for graph link prediction problems
## key questions
1. Can we build a foundational model using temporal point processes for graphs?
2. if a model trained on specific types of higher-order relations can generalize to different types in a zero-shot setting:
  1. For example, can a model trained on hyperedge and bipartite link prediction effectively handle bipartite hyperedge link prediction at test timE
4. how we can tokenize graphs or nodes in a way that adapts to unseen nodes.
5.  we can develop in-context learning in this case

## Current State of the Models for Temporal Graph Neural Networks:

## Tasks:
1. DyRep: Learning Representations over Dynamic Graphs (https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyePrhR5KX)
2. Temporal Graph Networks for Deep Learning on Dynamic Graphs (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10637)
